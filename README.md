# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> This repository contains the implementation for KNN multiclass classifier on MNIST Data.

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Algorithms.py contains KNN and XGB algorithms
* Main.py gives the accuracy score on the validation dataset for the KNN algorithm.
* Endsem.ipynb is the same thing but in jupyter notebook
* ML_lab_Endsem_Report.pdf is the report on this project.

---

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Mention all the related instructions for installation of related packages for running your code here.

---

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Main.py trains the model on the train data and gives the accuracy score after predicting on the validation data. So you have to change the files in the script.
* Or else, you can import the KNN class from the Algorithms.py file.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
